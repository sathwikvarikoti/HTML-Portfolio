<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Sathwik Varikoti, a dynamic and versatile full-stack developer who graduated from the University at Buffalo with a degree in Computer and Information Science.
  My academic journey provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing, equipping me with the skills necessary to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry.
  After graduation, I joined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), where I honed my expertise in full-stack development.
  My role at TCS involves working on complex projects, solving intricate problems, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions that meet client needs.

<p>  Outside the realm of coding and software development, I have a passion for badminton and photography.
  These interests offer a balance to my professional life, providing both physical activity and creative expression.
  Whether I'm on the badminton court or behind the camera lens, I bring the same dedication and meticulous attention to detail that I apply to my work in technology.
  Additionally, I enjoy writing creatively, a hobby that allows me to explore and articulate ideas beyond the technical scope.
  This blend of technical prowess, athletic enthusiasm, and artistic creativity makes me a well-rounded individual with a unique perspective on both my professional and personal endeavors.
